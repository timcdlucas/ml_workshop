notes and plan



To cover:

what is ml
what is it good at
what models count as ml

tasks: 
supervised
unsupervised
reinforcement learning

some examples
image analysis
chess
computer games


concepts
bias variance
regularisation
hyperparameter
hold out data
cross validation
inner and outer cross validation



how to do all that stuff with caret
a full workflow

other Frameworks
tidy models
mlr3
scikit learn



plan:

1 what is ml 
what models count
2 tasks
 famous examples
3 what is caret and it helps an interface with those many different models
4 fit RF in caret
- the data
- hold out
- error metric

5 what is ml good at
compare lm and RF in simplest caret

6 what is ml bad at
compare RF and Newton on planets and gravity
uncertainty


7 very flexible models
do x^6
overfitting
8 bias variance
9 we might call 6 a hyperparameter.
lots of models have hyperparameters that control how regularised the model is.

10 how do we choose it?
use hold out data
CV
Caret tune parameter

11 inner outer. use outer for main research question. which model is best or how well will my model work in the real world.


12 a full machine learning workflow.


extras:

13 match error metric to question
14 ask questions with cv
15-17 trees, RF, enet in a bit more detail.
18 no free lunch. try lots of models
