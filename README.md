Caret and zoon: machine learning, ecology and domain specific package systems
===============================================================================

Talk on two R packages, caret and zoon. 
Presenting to the Oxford rusers group. 
I'll discuss the scope and uses of both packages. 
I'll also discuss whether domain specific package ecosystems (which zoon aims to be) are a good idea and what makes them useful, difficult and different.
