Packages:
  zoon, palettetown, INLAutils, others.
  
Talk overview:
  Caret - a general package for machine learning
           - Could be seen as a domain specific package ecosystem
		   - New models are a simple wrapper in a caret specific format

  zoon - a general package for SDMs
           - What are SDMs
		   - Who wrote it?
		   - It absolutely is a domain specific package ecosystem
		   
		   
Caret
--------


What is machine learning?
  - supervised
  - Features -> response

Tasks
  - Classification (2 or many classes)
  - Regression
  - Plots of the two/three types.

Hyperparameters
  - An example: feature selection in linear regression
  - More generally
    
No free lunch.
  - Switching between models is important
  
What is caret?
  - Model list

Train
  - Fit a model with a unified interface
  
Cross-validation
  - Do cross validation with unified. 
  - Compare models
  
Hyperparameters
  - Use cross validation to selection
  - Uniform
  - tunelength vs tunegrid
  



Zoon
-------

What is species distribution modelling?

Who are zoon?

Zoon conceptual workflow

Example workflow

Example workflow with random forest

Model module
  - Similarities to caret are clear
  - In fact, here is MachineLearn module
  
  
  
Reproducilbility

Remix

Comparisons  






Domain specific ecosystems
-------------------------------

Are there other examples?

Are they a good thing?
